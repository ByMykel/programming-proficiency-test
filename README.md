# Introduction

First thing to mention is that I was unable to get the `docker-compose` command to work on my machine. I was getting the following error:

```

I've done the both parts of the assignment. The PHP part is the easiest one as there only 2 algorithms to implement. The Javascript part I've done all the bullet points and added some unit tests.

## Points to improve tht I didn't have time to do

- Responsive design. The table should be collapses into an accordion or enable horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
- Allow the user to sort the table by clicking on the column headers.
- Use a Icon library instead of the SVGs.
- Use a date picker library instead of the HTML5 date input.
- Add pagination to filter component as it could list thousands of records.
- Add some extra styles to remark important information as propery name or add some color to the status column.
